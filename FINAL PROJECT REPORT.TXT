Final Project Report: Local Network Port Scanning
ðŸ”¹ Project Title:
Local Network Port Scanning using Nmap and Wireshark

ðŸ”¹ Objective:
To identify open ports and services on devices in the local network, analyze associated network traffic using Wireshark, and evaluate potential security risks.

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used:

Nmap
Wireshark
Linux/Windows OS
GitHub (for version control and documentation)

ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed:

Installed Nmap from the official website.
Identified the local IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) using ipconfig/ifconfig.
Performed a TCP SYN scan using:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24

Noted down all live IPs and open ports.

ðŸ”¹ Scan Output Summary:
Port	State	Service
135/tcp	open	msrpc
139/tcp	open	netbios-ssn
445/tcp	open	microsoft-ds
3306/tcp	open	mysql
8000/tcp	open	http-alt
8089/tcp	open	unknown


Ran Wireshark simultaneously to capture network packets.


Researched common services found on open ports.




ðŸ”¹ Risk Analysis:
Port	Service 	    Risk Level	    Comments

135  	MSRPC	        Medium	        Targeted in Windows remote exploits.
139	    NetBIOS-SSN	    High	        Legacy protocol; exploitable via SMB vulnerabilities.
445	   Microsoft-DS	    High	        Frequently targeted by ransomware and lateral movement.
3306	MySQL	        Medium	        Vulnerable if exposed or misconfigured.
8000	HTTP-Alt	    Low         	Often used for testing; access control needed.
8089	Unknown/Splunk	Low	            Check Splunk or custom app exposure.

Analyzed risks and exposure based on scan findings.

Analyzed Services on Open Ports
ðŸ”¹ Port 135 â€“ MSRPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call)
What it does: Enables communication between Windows services. Used by DCOM and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
Risk: Often targeted in Windows exploits; can expose sensitive system operations.
Recommendation:
Block this port on public networks.
Use firewall rules to restrict access to trusted IPs only.

ðŸ”¹ Port 139 â€“ NetBIOS-SSN (NetBIOS Session Service)
What it does: Used for Windows file/printer sharing in older networks.
Risk: Vulnerable to NetBIOS spoofing and information disclosure attacks.
Recommendation:
Disable NetBIOS if not needed.
Block access to this port externally.

ðŸ”¹ Port 445 â€“ Microsoft-DS (Direct SMB over TCP)
What it does: Used by SMB protocol for file and printer sharing in Windows networks.
Risk: Heavily exploited (e.g., WannaCry, EternalBlue). Can be used for spreading malware across the network.

Recommendation:
Never expose port 445 to the internet.
Disable SMBv1, use SMBv2/3, and patch frequently.
Use internal firewalls to limit SMB access.

ðŸ”¹ Port 3306 â€“ MySQL Database
What it does: Default port for MySQL database server.
Risk: If exposed, it may allow attackers to brute-force database credentials or exploit vulnerabilities.
Recommendation:
Never expose MySQL to the internet unless secured with VPN or SSH tunneling.
Use strong credentials and limit access to known IPs.
Enable SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.

ðŸ”¹ Port 8000 â€“ HTTP-alt (Alternate HTTP Port)
What it does: Often used for development web servers, dashboards, or alternate web services.
Risk: May expose web apps or APIs that lack authentication or are still in development.
Recommendation:
Secure web services with authentication.
Hide sensitive interfaces behind VPN or firewall.
Regularly update the application and web frameworks.

ðŸ”¹ Port 8089 â€“ Unknown / Splunkd (in Splunk setups)
What it does: Often used by Splunk for management and REST API access.
Risk: If Splunk or other apps use this port and are misconfigured, it can expose sensitive data or allow remote control.
Recommendation:
Restrict this port to localhost or internal trusted IPs.
Use SSL and require authentication.
Disable unused services bound to this port.
Saved scan result and PCAP file for documentation.


âœ… Assessed Vulnerabilities and Saved Results
1. ðŸ”“ Port 135 â€“ MSRPC
Vulnerability: Used in exploits like MS03-026 (Blaster worm).
Exposure: Exposing this port allows remote execution or denial-of-service attacks.

Fix:
Block access to port 135 from external IPs.
Apply Windows updates regularly.

2. ðŸ”“ Port 139 â€“ NetBIOS-SSN
Vulnerability: Susceptible to enumeration and man-in-the-middle attacks (e.g., NBNS poisoning).
Exposure: Can leak usernames, shares, and hostnames.

Fix:
Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP if not required.
Block port 139 on firewalls.

3. ðŸ”“ Port 445 â€“ Microsoft-DS (SMB)
Vulnerability: Exploited by ransomware (e.g., WannaCry via EternalBlue).
Exposure: Remote code execution and lateral movement.
Fix:

Disable SMBv1.
Apply latest patches.
Use firewalls to isolate SMB access internally only.

4. ðŸ”“ Port 3306 â€“ MySQL
Vulnerability: Brute-force attacks or unauthenticated access to database.
Exposure: Full database access if credentials are weak.

Fix:
Disable remote access if unnecessary.
Use strong passwords and firewall rules.
Limit access to trusted IPs only.

5. ðŸ”“ Port 8000 â€“ HTTP-alt
Vulnerability: Often hosts debug or development environments with little to no security.
Exposure: May reveal APIs, logs, or admin panels.

Fix:
Restrict access with authentication.
Do not expose dev interfaces publicly.

6. ðŸ”“ Port 8089 â€“ Unknown (commonly Splunkd)
Vulnerability: Can expose monitoring interfaces or API endpoints.
Exposure: Misconfigured Splunk instances may allow remote queries or config access.

Fix:
Use HTTPS with authentication.
Limit access to internal IPs.



ðŸ”¹ Security Recommendations:

Disable unused services (especially SMB and NetBIOS).
Restrict MySQL and web ports with firewalls or local ACLs.
Apply patches and updates regularly.
Use strong passwords and avoid default credentials.
Continuously monitor the network using IDS/IPS tools.

ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings:

Understood how port scanning reveals the attack surface.
Gained hands-on experience using Nmap and interpreting results.
Observed how port scans look in packet captures (via Wireshark).
Practiced basic threat analysis on network services.
